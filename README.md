![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4802f509-4187-444c-8755-b21fd568b3fb)

This repository contains a simple voice assistant project implemented in Python using a Jupyter Notebook. The assistant can recognize voice commands and perform basic tasks, demonstrating the use of speech recognition and text-to-speech technologies.

## Features

- 🎤 **Speech Recognition:** Listens to your voice commands using your microphone.
- 🗣️ **Text-to-Speech:** Responds to you with spoken feedback.
- 🔎 **Performs Basic Tasks:** (e.g., searching the web, telling the time, opening applications, etc.)
- 📝 **Easy to Understand:** All code and logic are in a single Jupyter Notebook for easy learning and experimentation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

### Required Python Packages

Install the following packages before running the notebook:

```sh
pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 pyaudio
```

> **Note:**  
> If you have trouble installing `pyaudio`, refer to [PyAudio installation instructions](https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/#downloads) for your operating system.
